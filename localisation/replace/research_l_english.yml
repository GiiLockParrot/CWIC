 tech_field_hospital_desc:0 "Medical companies are support companies comprised of medical staff including field surgeons, combat medics, nurses, and so on. They tend to the health and well-being of soldiers in the field. The simplest medical companies simply equip medical personnel with lightweight equipment and give them training and discipline to handle the horrors of war. It isn’t necessary to train them to work under pressure and time constraints because medical personnel always have to work like that."
 tech_field_hospital2:0 "Medicine II; Field Hospitals"
 tech_field_hospital2_desc:0 "Creating portable field hospitals greatly aids in assisting the wounded. Incapacitated soldiers taken to field hospitals where medical equipment is set up have a much greater chance of surviving than medics trying to patch them up while they are getting shot at in the mud. Field hospitals must have lightweight equipment and armored field ambulances in order to be portable with the army and recover soldiers during active battle."
 tech_field_hospital3:0 "Medicine III; Portable Hospital Equipment"
 tech_field_hospital3_desc:0 "While having massive machines and full hospital beds with monitors can be great ways to save lives, brick-and-mortar hospitals are unfortunately not transportable. Creating lightweight, portable variants of medical equipment found in hospitals allows field hospitals to more closely match their permanent counterparts and further aid the lives of soldiers."
 tech_field_hospital4:0 "Medicine IV; Adv Physio/Psycho Conditioning"
 tech_field_hospital4_desc:0 "Naturally, it helps to be healthy when your life's on the line and it makes the doctor’s job easy and gives a better chance of survival. Through medical research, medical companies can monitor and improve the physical and mental health of the soldiers in the field in order to ensure that they have strong bones, muscles, immune systems, and minds so that they can better survive the trauma of medical injuries in battle."
 tech_field_hospital5:0 "Medicine V; Military Medical Research"
 tech_field_hospital5_desc:0 "Civilian doctors and medical researchers (hopefully) do not have to deal with vast levels of patients coming in with extreme combat injuries on a regular basis. It is for this reason that the art of combat medicine only gained scientific insight when wars are in progress or the country is vastly unstable. Although if a country is unstable, there aren’t likely to be that many doctors with well funded hospitals. Therefore, it is prudent to include medical researchers who can study and create new techniques and medical supplies to deal with combat injuries."
 tech_field_hospital6:0 "Medicine VI; Military Psychiatrists"
 tech_field_hospital6_desc:0 "Not everyone who is put out of commission in the military is killed or wounded. The violent and hellish nature of warfare leaves many soldiers with PTSD. This unfortunate state leaves veterans infirm or unable to return to civilian life and unable to continue serving in the military. Military psychiatrists exist to aid mentally traumatized soldiers and allow them to continue serving in the military or be discharged and able to peacefully return to civilian life with minimal to no psychiatric problems or PTSD triggers."
 tech_field_hospital7:0 "Medicine VII; Military Trauma Medicine"
 tech_field_hospital7_desc:0 "The logical conclusion of CIMR, trauma medicine involves specialized equipment to deal with extreme injuries and stabilize severe physiological problems associated with major trauma. This, combined with the necessity of lightweight, compact medicine in warfare pushes medical ingenuity to its brink. This includes temporary artificial organs that perform simple tasks, high potency anesthetics, highly advanced aids, and miniaturized trauma ward equipment. Military trauma medicine can bring soldiers that would be considered doomed in prior years back from the edge."
 
 ##LOGISTICS 
 
 tech_logistics_company:0 "Logistics I; Logistic Corps"
 tech_logistics_company_desc:0 "Logistic Corps are dedicated non-combat personnel who provide supply and provisions to an army. One of the most important elements of an army, logistic corps provide ammunition, provisions, and spare parts to an army so that it can continue fighting. Additionally, specialized corps and officers manage networks and reduce waste which can greatly help reduce total consumption."
 tech_logistics_company2:0 "Logistics II; Convoy Escorts"
 tech_logistics_company2_desc:0 "Logistics convoys are prime targets for infiltration operatives and behind-enemy-lines operations. By gauging risks and securing supply lines with patrols and escorts, supplies can be protected and valuable provisions that are normally destroyed can be saved, further reducing overall consumption."
 tech_logistics_company3:0 "Logistics III; Supply Standardization"
 tech_logistics_company3_desc:0 "Different manufacturers or regions will usually have their own ways of storing and labelling provisions. This can cause a serious burden for logistical corps. As such, it is important to develop a national standardized catalog of military provisions to make it easier for supply officers to manage."
 tech_logistics_company4:0 "Logistics IV; Light/Compact Containers"
 tech_logistics_company4_desc:0 "Weight is a serious concern in logistics. Vehicles can only transport so much weight and even still have restrictions to the volume of contents they can transport. By creating lightweight, strong, compact containers, more supply can be shipped faster and more fuel efficiently."
 tech_logistics_company5:0 "Logistics V; All-Terrain Supply Corps"
 tech_logistics_company5_desc:0 "You cannot always rely on using your enemy’s infrastructure and roads. They may be destroyed in an action of scorched earth or may not exist in the first place. On that note, you can’t always rely on your own infrastructure not being destroyed or even existing. It is important that supply vehicles and logistics officers be able to travel off-road and find new paths in order to improve movement."
 tech_logistics_company6:0 "Logistics VI; Efficient Air Missions"
 tech_logistics_company6_desc:0 "Air missions and paradropped supplies can be lost, destroyed, captured by the enemy or partisans, or even take up large quantities of fuel to deliver. By revising paradropping plans and the chutes themselves, air missions can deliver needed supply in faster amounts of time. "
 tech_logistics_company7:0 "Logistics VII; High-Capacity Vehicles"
 tech_logistics_company7_desc:0 "When all management methods and protocols have been fully optimized, the only thing left to do is just make vehicles stronger, more efficient, and hold more. That’s all there is to it."
 
 ##MP
 
 tech_military_police:0 "Military Police I; MP Corps"
 tech_military_police_desc:0 "Military Police are dedicated officer corps that maintain order within’ a division as well as provide security in a combat zone. War is, by its very nature, destructive. Government officials, police, and security operatives are natural targets and belligerents in a conflict so military police must retain order and suppress insurgency. Basic military police are no more advanced or different from normal police forces with the exception of more combat training and the ability to establish beats within’ an unfamiliar zone."
 tech_military_police2:0 "Military Police II; Counter-Insurgent Operations"
 tech_military_police2_desc:0 "Insurgents and partisans can be extremely dangerous to a war operation and provide problems on a strategic level. From sabotage to ambushes to providing the enemy with intel, anyone can become an insurgent. Being able to hunt insurgents and partisans and suppress rebellion in a warzone is a critical operation. Firearms and weapons must be confiscated, militia cells must be found and destroyed, and the operatives themselves must be terminated. Therefore special equipment and militarized variants of police equipment must be made and protocols for suppression must be planned."
 tech_military_police3:0 "Military Police III; Riot Control"
 tech_military_police3_desc:0 "Aside from militia cells, disorganized riots can also arise from rebelling populations who do not have an understanding of guerilla warfare or resistance theory. Although not as dangerous as a fully organized militia cell, riots can cause serious disorder, prevent access to resources and industry, and rally support for partisans. It is therefore necessary to control and put down riots. However, using shear lethal force, although easy and effective, only radicalizes local populations and fulfills the riot’s initial purpose. Thus, developing military grade riot control techniques in order to maintain order and suppress demonstration is of vital importance."
 support_tech_military_police3_tt:0 "§YReduces likelihood of a successful riot in occupied territory by§! §G-35%§!"
 tech_military_police4:0 "Military Police IV; War Relief Corps"
 tech_military_police4_desc:0 "It is not enough to merely suppress resistance and pacify populations. Peaceful resistance is always possible and can be problematic. Additionally, the shear devastation caused by war can lead partisans to form cells. Providing war relief is prudent for numerous reasons. War relief helps a region recover faster during and after a war. War relief helps maintain wealth and development that would otherwise be lost. War relief speeds up recovery. Finally, providing war relief can win the most important war of all. The war of hearts and minds. "
 tech_military_police5:0 "Military Police V; Peacekeeping"
 tech_military_police5_desc:0 "Peacekeeping is a proactive measure to preventing uprisings and reducing devastation. Peacekeeping operations typically involve training new, local security forces to enforce the law and restore normalcy. Order and stability are the greatest methods of pacification. Peacekeeping requires military police to be trained to establish local security and vet for individuals who will not wind up becoming problems to become those security operatives. Additionally, it requires logistical lines for security provisions to be established so security beats can be established."
 tech_military_police6:0 "Military Police VI; Memetic Suppression"
 tech_military_police6_desc:0 "Winning hearts and minds with war relief and peacekeeping are good ways to prevent insurgency. However, not everyone is convinced, especially patriots and demagogues. It is therefore necessary to use fear as a tool to suppress other individuals. However, this fear cannot be delivered in such a way that it interferes with war relief or peacekeeping. Military reporters, propaganda, memetic warfare and ideological debating, and other such methods are ways to sow doubt within’ an occupied population. "
 tech_military_police7:0 "Military Police VII; Modern Non-Lethal Weapons and Tactics"
 tech_military_police7_desc:0 "Non-lethal tactics and weapons have been used since the dawn of human civilization and are naturally a part of occupation. However, dealing with domestic crime is a different game than dealing with insurgents. To better control the population and not inspire resistance and provide psychological suppression, new methods for incapacitation must be created. Investing large amounts into developing non-lethal weapons, chemicals, training, and equipment will pay off by enabling smaller amounts of troops to have a greater suppressive impact."
 
 ##SIGNAL
 
 tech_signal_company:0 "Signal I; Command and Control"
 tech_signal_company_desc:0 "Signal Companies maintain organization and communication within’ a division and outside of it. Using communications equipment, signal companies can aid in the command and control of a division and enable it to react to situations better than before. Command and Control requires signal specialists and communications equipment."
 tech_signal_company2:0 "Signal II; C3"
 tech_signal_company2_desc:0 "C3 stands for Communications, Command, and Control. With the implementation of C3, units can now communicate between one another and react dynamically to enemy movements and breakthroughs and respond accordingly. C3 requires signal specialists to be integrated throughout a division in many different areas to relay information and provide greater awareness."
 tech_signal_company3:0 "Signal III; Interoperability"
 tech_signal_company3_desc:0 "Interoperability is the advancement of C3. Interoperability is the advancement of doctrines in communication and direct efforts between combat elements. This way, combat elements are able to communicate with each-other without the need of a signal liaison and can aid each-other through their own initiative. "
 tech_signal_company4:0 "Signal IV; ISTAR"
 tech_signal_company4_desc:0 "ISTAR stands for Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition, and Reconnaissance. It is the active communication between recon elements and everyone on the communications network. ISTAR enables recon elements to communicate information to the rest of a division with high efficiency. It also enables recon elements to aid in providing information to combat elements that need them."
 tech_signal_company5:0 "Signal V; MISI"
 tech_signal_company5_desc:0 "Modern Information System Integration [MISI] is the integration of modern systems information such as portable computers to aid in tactical control. With MISI, unparalleled levels of direct tactical control can be established between command staff and the operating combat elements. MISI enables consultation between experienced senior staff and low-ranking officers to provide greater combat and tactical capability."
 tech_signal_company6:0 "Signal VI; Personal Comms"
 tech_signal_company6_desc:0 "Personal Comms are pieces of communications equipment granted to almost all individuals within’ a division. This can further allow communications to be maintained as the incapacitation of a signals specialist does not necessarily mean the end of communications. Developing personal comms requires miniaturization of communications equipment and protocols for cutting off the operability of compromised equipment."
 tech_signal_company7:0 "Signal VII; OVERLORD"
 tech_signal_company7_desc:0 "OVERLORD is a theoretical battle interface that has not yet been fully implemented by any country due to the sheer expense of developing the software needed and maintaining and updating it. OVERLORD creates an interface created and updated by command staff based off of continuous recon reports and information coming in. This allows for a level of interoperability, communication, and command never before seen that can enable virtually all troops to receive information on nearby troops and avoid conflicts they cannot deal with while precisely engaging hostiles they are able to. As long as someone is aware of an enemy presence, and communications are still online, everyone can be aware of it. "
 
 ##MAINTENANCE 
 
 tech_maintenance_company:0 "Maintenance I; Army Mechanics"
 tech_maintenance_company_desc:0 "Maintenance companies are dedicated non-combat units that specialize in the maintenance and repair of military weapons and equipment. While most routine cleaning and maintenance can be performed by the soldiers that operate the weapons and equipment, dedicated mechanics can do the job more efficiently and relieve a lot of the effort on part from the soldiers themselves so they can focus on other things. Mechanics are the most basic but amongst the most important elements of a maintenance company."
 tech_maintenance_company2:0 "Maintenance II; Management"
 tech_maintenance_company2_desc:0 "Maintenance management and military foremen are crucial to the efficiency of maintenance companies. By implementing management strategies and policies in the field, they are able to greatly improve the speed and efficiency by which repairs and maintenance are conducted. "
 tech_maintenance_company3:0 "Maintenance III; Improved Tools and Equipment"

 tech_maintenance_company4:0 "Maintenance IV; Further Improved Tools and Equipment"
 tech_maintenance_company4_desc:0 "Further optimizing tools to make them more reliable and easy-to-handle aids field repairs and regular maintenance even more."
 tech_maintenance_company5:0 "Maintenance V; Versatile Parts"
 tech_maintenance_company5_desc:0 "In warfare it isn’t uncommon to find maintenance companies running out of components or spare parts. The parts that are damaged or destroyed are highly inconsistent and unpredictable due to the nature of combat. It is for this reason that having stores of extra versatile parts and patching kits that are intended to only be applied temporarily is desirable. Through intense development efforts and investment, these kits and parts can be created for field repairs in order to keep vehicles and weapons in the fight long enough that they can receive permanent repairs."
 tech_maintenance_company6:0 "Maintenance VI; Combat Mechanics"
 tech_maintenance_company6_desc:0 "The most dire repair situations can occur in the heat of a firefight. Tanks can become detracked, vehicles can be shot, and various other forms of damage can occur. Field repairs have always been a difficult task and have always been pressing. By training mechanics to work faster and under intense pressure, they can conduct these repairs more efficiently and get their vehicles back in the fight."
 tech_maintenance_company7:0 "Maintenance VII; Digital Manuals"

 aam_short_range_0_short:0 "Radar Beam-riding"
 aam_short_range_0_desc:0 "The first practical air to air missiles used radar beam riding to find their targets. The missile uses a tail-mounted receiver to fly down the center of a radio beam aimed at the target by the launching aircraft."
 aam_long_range_0:0 "Conical-Scan Semi-Active Radar Homing Air-to-Air Missile"
 aam_long_range_0_short:0 "Semi-Active Radar"
 aam_long_range_0_desc:0 "Semi-active radar homing missiles home on the launching aircraft's radar returns bounced off the target. In conjunction with a conical-scan seeker, the missile can calculate the relative angular rate and the direction to steer to reach the target."
 aam_short_range_1:0 "Reticle IR Air-to-Air Missile"
 aam_short_range_1_short:0 "Reticle IR"
 aam_short_range_1_desc:0 "Reticle Infrared seekers use a slotted spinning reticle in front of a single-channel detector to identify the target's angular position relative to the missile. The missile can then be flown to impact using a guidance law such as porportional navigation. However, early IR detectors can only lock onto engine exhausts and must be fired from the rear aspect, limiting their effectiveness."
 aam_long_range_1:0 "Early Active Radar Air-to-Air Missile"
 aam_long_range_1_short:0 "Early Active Radar"
 aam_long_range_1_desc:0 "Active radar homing puts an entire radar set onto the missile, tracking the target using the missile's own radar emissions. However, early active radar homing systems were large and power-hungry, relegating them to only the largest missiles."

 aam_long_range_2_short:0 "Inverse Monopulse SARH"
 aam_long_range_2_desc:0 "Inverse Monopulse seekers replaces the spinning conical seeker in early SARH missiles with a direction-finding approach based on differential polarization of two radar returns. By transmitting two signals at once from the illuminating radar at two different polarizations, the angular position of the target relative to the seeker can be uniquely determined. Moreover, ground returns can be filtered out, enabling look-down-shoot-down engagements."
 aam_short_range_3:0 "IR Focal Plane Array Air-to-Air Missile"
 aam_short_range_3_short:0 "IR Focal Plane Array"
 aam_short_range_3_desc:0 "Infrared focal plane arrays replace single-channel infrared seekers with detectors that closer approximate a camera. Instead of using a single pixel and a spinning reticle to identify a target's angular position, a FPA is a wide-angle thermal camera able to identify targets based on shape, size, and performance characteristics. FPA-based seekers offer improved range and countermeasures resistance."
 aam_long_range_3:0 "Modern Active Radar Homing Air-to-Air Missile"
 aam_long_range_3_short:0 "Modern Active Radar"
 aam_long_range_3_desc:0 "Advances in microwave integrated circuits allow active radar homing seekers to be miniaturized into traditionally medium-range missile envelopes. In turn, this allows launching aircraft to fire their missiles and turn away from the target, rather than having to provide continous illumination as with SARH."
 aam_short_range_4:0 "High Off Boresight Air-to-Air Missile"
 aam_short_range_4_short:0 "High Off Boresight"
 aam_short_range_4_desc:0 "High off boresight missiles can be directed towards the target before launch using a helmet mounted sight, obviating the need for the launching aircraft to be pointed at the target. Once launched, the missile uses an onboard inertial navigation system to turn towards the indicated direction, then acquires the target once on course."
 aam_long_range_4:0 "Variable Ducted Rocket Air-to-Air Missile"
 aam_long_range_4_short:0 "Variable Ducted Rocket"
 aam_long_range_4_desc:0 "Variable ducted rockets are a mixture of traditional rockets and ramjets. A valved solid rocket motor produces fuel-rich exhaust that is then fed into a combustion cavity fed from the outside airstream. By adjusting the valve, the fuel flow rate and thus the thrust can be modulated, offering better specific impulse and trajectory shaping ability compared to traditional rockets."

 software_I_desc:0 "While mechanical computing may have served an important role early on in assisting researchers and engineers before and during WW2, the complex needs of the growing world presented the need to develop computers beyond what they could do simply with gears and preset calculations. Early computing theories led to the development of early electronic computers that more or less served the same role with similar capacity to mechanical computers but in a way that allowed them to take on vastly larger tasks and bring about the first major computers."
 software_II_desc:0 "The preset programming of early computers left a lot to be desired and only allowed computers to take on highly specific tasks with arduously assembled programs. Binary programming languages allowed computers to take on a vastly larger diversity of tasks and would also allow a greater level of accessibility in computing."
 software_III_desc:0 "A high-level programming language is a programming language that abstracts from the binary details of the computer’s processing itself. They read natural language [IE add_research_slot = 50] and turn that into a processable element. This allows them to be programmed on a macro level without the need to individually assign unabstracted elements to process data. "
 software_IV_desc:0 "The quicksort algorithm is an efficiency sorting algorithm developed by Tony Hoare in 1959 that systematically places elements into an organized array. It is used to sort data in a computer and outdid prior sorting algorithms like merge sort and heapsort. Sorting is an extremely common process conducted in computer software and as such, needs to be highly efficient and a poorly created sorting algorithm can lead to unnecessarily large processing loads. Quicksort is still used today because it’s just that good."
 software_V_desc:0 "Packet switching is a method of grouping digital sata and transmitting it over a digital network. They are led by a header and the data itself is in the payload which trails the header. The header navigates a network according to the data placed in it. This allows data to navigate highly complex networks where there are multiple hosts to reach and different data nodes to travel between. However, there are a few issues such as packet loss which affect packet switching networks. Wireless transmission [not available at the time of researching this] and network congestion can cause packets to fail to reach their destination and be lost. The Transmission Control Protocol is an internet protocol that ensures accurate data transfer and detects when packets are lost so it can try again or correct the errors."
 software_VI_desc:0 "Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a part of fluid mechanics that uses numerical analysis to solve problems with fluid flow. This software allows computers to simulate the free-stream flow of liquids and gases. This highly complex software benefits greatly from strong computers and can allow engineers to simulate many different problems involving aerodynamics, fluids, weather, etc. CFD problems fundamentally rely on the Navier-Stokes equations that define single-phase fluid flows."
 software_VII_desc:0 "Eventually, modular, large-scale massively-parallel supercomputers became possible. As a result of design improvements and better administrative domains and internal protocols, massively-parallel supercomputers could become vast in size. These supercomputers can be used to store or back up more data than before, and process more than early models. Because they have so much value and purpose confined to a single space, these supercomputers are usually kept under extreme security underground with heavily vetted personnel being the only ones allowed to work on them physically. "

 software_IX_desc:0 "Computer-aided drawing [CAD] is the use of computer systems to aid in the creation of a design. CAD software makes designing far easier and improves productivity and quality quite a bit. It can also provide easy-access databases, communication tools, macros, and other toolkits to further aid the designing process. CAD software can be used to design many different things including machines, architecture, electronics, etc. With computer-aided manufacturing, CAD can directly allow machines to precisely carry out designs with extreme precision and efficiency."
 software_X_desc:0 "64-bit computing is the use of 64-bit architecture in computers. Every 1 or 0 in a binary language takes up 1 bit. In 64-bit architecture, 64-bits are arranged into a single memory address, which is a reference to a specific memory location used at software and hardware levels. What makes 64-bits special is because 64-bit computers have an integer limit of 9,223,372,036,854,775,807, whereas 32-bit systems are capped at about 2.147 billion. This allows far more unique variables to be stored and processed by a system than ever before. There are simpler programs today that still use 32-bit, but many softwares need to use 64-bit architecture because of their sheer complexity."
 software_XI_desc:0 "Multi-threading is the ability of a CPU to provide multiple threads of execution concurrently. Multithreading increased the utilization of a single core by using thread-level parallelism and instruction-level parallelism. This enables a greater level of flexibility when multitasking whether a single core or multiple cores were being used.\nWhile simultaneous multi-threading has been around since 1968 and deployed within’ a few years of that, this technology represents the optimization of multi-threading protocols and the introduction of protocols to protect against multiple threads sharing hardware resources like caches and a high level of efficiency."
 software_XII_desc:0 "Developing military logistics software eases a lot of the work on the general military staff and allows for a greater level of reliability in large military logistics networks and the organization of complex supply chains on a massive scale. This software can allow supply officers to put in orders digitally and improves the communication on complex networks. Additionally, this software can ease triages and supply prioritization as well as helps automatically locate anomalies in the supply lines."
 software_XIII_desc:0 "The 3rd Generation of Software Debugging software features numerous improvements over former generations. The 3rd generation has a few advantages over former generations including optimization grading and proactive memory debugging that can actively find memory corruption bugs and spot processes which use anomalous amounts of system resources. This software will pave the way for far more complex programs to be developed and greatly aids in software development."

 radar_0_desc:0 "Throughout WWII, many advancements in radar were made. Early on, radar simply used radio detection which was very crude and inefficient. This was eventually sharpened to create decimetric radar, which could detect incoming planes from further away and do so more precisely. Eventually, decimetric radar was lengthened to centimetric to enable long range radar detection. In order to lengthen the radar waves, significant improvements to the strength of the cavity magnetron are made. The cavity magnetron is a high powered vacuum tube used to generate microwaves and turn them into radio waves. It was made stronger than ever and could create very powerful centimetric beams."
 radar_I_desc:0 "Doppler Beam Sharpening is a method of processing radar signals into a radar-image. Using a synthetic aperture, the motion of the radar antenna provides finer spatial resolution than conventional beam-scanning radars. SAR defines a 3D array of scene elements using returns from the beam. With this array, SAR runs algorithms and calculations to determine a precise image of whatever it is scanning."
 radar_II_desc:0 "Monopulse radar is a radar system that encodes its radio signal on different levels so when the beam bounces back, it provides highly accurate data based on how the different pulses come back. Because the radio signal uses additional encoding it is able to emit only 1 pulse for accurate data hence the name ‘monopulse’."
 radar_III_desc:0 "Over-the-Horizon Radar aka Skywave Radar is a radar that transmits a powerful shortwave signal that reaches beyond the horizon by reflecting off of the ionosphere in the sky to hit the ground over the horizon and then back to the sky and to the radar antennas again. This allows OtH to detect targets behind obstacles and over extremely long distances."

The first electronic encryption system, the KW-26, was created. It used more than 800 cores and 50 vacuum-tube driver circuits to create encrypted messages using magnetic core logic. The digital encryption system enabled it to create messages more encrypted than ever before."
 enc_II_desc:0 "In order to encrypt information better, numerous improvements to the electronic encryption system need to be made. More combinations need to be added to prevent the likelihood of the machine using the same card multiple times. More measures need to be taken to prevent access to the machine. Also more layers must be added to the encrypted messages."
 enc_III_desc:0 "DES is the first public encryption standard created. The DES was created in 1975 by IBM. DES is a systemic-key algorithm meaning it used the same key for both encryption and decryption. As long as the key is kept secret between the 2 parties, the encryption is highly secure. If the key is guessed through a long and time-consuming brute force attack, or if the key is stolen quickly via malware, then the messages can be decrypted. DES is highly secure against differential cryptanalysis because the encryption keys are kept secret and unique, but is vulnerable against bruteforce cracking."
 enc_IV_desc:0 "The Firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on security rules. Firewalls can effectively prevent malware that has infected a system from submitting information out of the system or prevent unauthorized access into a system. "
 enc_V_desc:0 "With the advent of malicious software comes the need for a dynamic approach to protecting against general vulnerability. While vulnerabilities can be patched, the never ending cold war of vulnerabilities vs exploits places the encrypter at a serious disadvantage. Dynamic antiviruses designed to directly block known malicious software signatures or heuristically block suspicious software activity. This enables defenses to stay ahead of threats by creating more advanced anti-viruses and anti-malwares."
 enc_VI_desc:0 "Simply reactively combatting viruses and known malicious signatures is not enough. As software becomes more ubiquitous and the world becomes more networked, the dangers continue to increase. Heuristic anti-malware software is proactive and can attempt to search for malicious activity on a computer and react to security breaches without prior knowledge of the malicious program’s functions.

 decryption_I_desc:0 "While the first electronic encryption systems were more complex than ever before, they could be defeated. If a key was ever reused, then the 2 stream ciphered messages could be compared and decrypted by automatically figuring out the machine’s logic via a reused key attack. Bit-flipping is another attack that relies on already knowing part of a message. If the encrypted messages follow a certain format, then it is easy to use the known information as a base. "
 decryption_II_desc:0 "Differential cryptanalysis is a method of attack in which pairs of plaintext and ciphertext are abused in a cryptological system in order to discover a key. This requires access to the plaintext and ciphertext inputs and outputs. By inputting a variety of messages and comparing them to the encrypted text, the encrypting key can be discovered and used against the desired encrypted information."
 decryption_III_desc:0 "Brute force, as the name implies, is an extremely simplistic and straightforward method of decryption. By simply attempting every possible solution or key until you arrive at a solution with immense processing power, an encrypted message can be deciphered. It can be used on virtually all cryptosystems assuming that enough processing power is available. However, as encryption becomes more advanced, this can eventually become infeasible as higher levels of encryption may require more processing power than is reasonably available. "
 decryption_IV_desc:0 "Hacking has numerous definitions but here it references gaining unauthorized access to a computer system through the use of software. Remotely gaining access to systems by exploiting vulnerabilities in software can allow a hacker to compromise a network and gaina access to, destroy, or manipulate data within' a protected network."
 decryption_V_desc:0 "Malware is any program with malicious intent and spyware is any program which unwillingly gathers information from a host. \nWhile attempting to gather information from a host indirectly through decrypting messages is useful, it becomes infeasible as modern cryptography becomes too advanced. Instead, taking measures to breach vulnerabilities in software remotely is desirable to access the unencrypted information directly. Additionally, creating malicious software or spyware to infect a host via vulnerabilities or traps can open backdoors by themselves. "
 decryption_VI_desc:0 "An exploit kit is a collection of exploits for vulnerabilities organized in a massive catalog acting as a repository. Exploit kits contain massive numbers of exploits for virtually all vulnerabilities in virtually all versions of virtually all software targeted by an exploit kit’s maker. Doing this enables a malware creator or hacker to simply create the malware they desire and attach a functional exploit. All a malware creator needs to know is the software and versions of a piece of software that a target computer uses and they can browse the exploit kit. If the exploit kit makers have found a vulnerability and made the exploit, the malware creator merely needs to hook it and expose the target computer to it. Government-owned kits can keep vulnerabilities secret for years until they desire to launch a massive attack."

 inframanagement_I_desc:0 "Urban planning is the process of planning the expansion of or improvements to an urban environment. Involves careful management and systems designed to segregate building specializations into residences, commerce, industry, or any hybrid of the above. Urban planning seeks to place buildings in area where they can perform the most effectively to one another and provide specialized infrastructure to support the enterprises in that area.\nThis technology represents fundamental post war urban planning systems that adapt to the needs of modern industry that go beyond the basic industrial era urban planning systems. Greatly aids future infrastructure expansions."
 inframanagement_II_desc:0 "Modern infrastructure construction equipment is necessary to build the increasingly complex infrastructure networks of the atomic era. High-strength hydraulic systems, elevating scrapers, hydraulic bulldozers, pipelayers, hydraulic pavement millers, and countless other heavy-duty vehicles are needed to construct atomic era infrastructure in reasonable times. Generally this technology represents moving away from cable centric systems and toward hydraulics."
 inframanagement_III_desc:0 "Besides urban planning, specifically planning industrial spaces and organizing them in such a way that it is easy for all industries in an area to operate, store goods, and receive deliveries can greatly improve industrial infrastructure construction and improve industrial throughput. Specifically planning spaces for current and future industrial infrastructure paves the way for easy improvements and expansions of industrial spaces."
 inframanagement_IV_desc:0 "A general infrastructure management improvement. Involves implementing better management and organization techniques, increasing the number of road classifications, and improving systems and protocols for drives to use. These organization improvements are typically taken into play in order for city planners to make better use of the terrain and make upgrades/maintenance easier."
 inframanagement_V_desc:0 "Sustainable and robust road materials reduce the costs of building and maintaining roads and are also important for being able to withstand the weight of heavy industrial traffic. Additionally, sustainable road materials are easier to recycle after being milled, thus lowering the costs of maintenance and building even further. Lower building/maintenance time and costs means construction teams and public workers can spend more time expanding existing infrastructure or to the very least spend less time working which is welcome to say the least."
 inframanagement_VI_desc:0 "Improving infrastructure maintenance with better procedures and equipment makes maintaining and building large amounts of infrastructure easier. Includes equipment advancements such as ergonomic controls, high speed equipment, high power modern engines, hybrid multi-purpose equipment, electronics integration, and modern hydraulics. Procedural improvements involve better scheduling of repairs and remote monitoring."

 infrastate_I_desc:0 "Diesel-electric propulsion, post-war hydraulic systems, and high capacity railway infrastructure systems greatly improve the power and efficiency of railways. Diesel-electric engines use diesel engines to drive a DC or AC generator to power the traction motor and increases the speed and fuel efficiency of the trains. Additionally, improving railways with railway equipment optimized for rapid loading and unloading of trains minimizes the amount of time that trains on busy lines have to spend at the station and allows them to get more done."
 infrastate_II_desc:0 "Arterial freeways are exceptionally wide controlled-access highways that are designed for high-speed vehicular traffic and allow industrial, commercial, civilian, or government traffic to cross large spans of land. Arterial freeways allow high-capacity traffic roads to deliver traffic to them through collector roads which allow traffic to speed up and merge onto or leave arterial freeways. Proper planning and mathematics are crucial as arterial freeways which do not grant enough space for collector roads may cause safety issues while excessively large collector roads may simply waste space and money and, due to their nature and heavy usage, cause maintenance issues."
 infrastate_III_desc:0 "Disasters, war, emergencies, and countless other problems can pull service reinforcements from far away. Creating limited access infrastructure can allow police, fire, disaster, military, or other traffic to respond to situations more promptly without having to directly compete with potentially panicked civilian traffic. Special situation infrastructure can allow police reinforcements to arrive to other cities more promptly, fire or disaster services to respond more quickly, military supply to improve, amongst other improvements. Additionally, this infrastructure can generally be used by all government traffic for whatever the government deems necessary."
 infrastate_IV_desc:0 "High speed rail (HSR) operates significantly faster than traditional railways. HSR uses an integrated system of specialized rolling stock and dedicated tracks to go in excess of 200 kilometers per hour (120 mph). Commonly known as bullet trains, high speed railways allow industries to make deliveries in short amounts of time at very long distances or transport passengers in record time to improve productivity and easily deal with emergency or express deliveries without having to rely on more expensive express flights. Additionally, HSR trains can be more fuel efficient and even fully electric, allowing them to reduce fossil fuel dependencies in a country."
 infrastate_V_desc:0 "Effectively a hybrid between trunk roads and arterial freeways, controlled-access industrial expressways are specialized to cater to the needs of industrial traffic and enable RGOs or industries to ship products across larger areas without having to share the way with smaller traffic or less professional drivers. Additionally, more predictable traffic minimizes jams caused by erratic or impatient non-professional drivers which allows more consistent delivery times."
 infrastate_VI_desc:0 "MAGLEV (magnetic levitation) rails use magnets to repel and push the train off the track and have another set to move the elevated train ahead effectively creating a frictionless train that can move at extreme speeds on a full electrified line. They are extremely fast, quiet, smooth, and have vastly better braking system. The MAGLEV system is so powerful that the only practical limitation for MAGLEV lines is the safety of the passengers and conductor that it transports and the amount of power that it uses. Although in the future, remote systems may be used in which the limitation will become the speed at which the magnet can move and the system can stabilize the train itself. "
 infrastate_VII_desc:0 "Vactrains are MAGLEV lines that are vastly more energy efficient and can move at much higher speeds by overcoming drag by simply having the train move in a vacuum tunnel. In order to take advantage of the higher speeds, vactrains will need to be remotely controlled and contain no passengers and be segregated from traditional MAGLEV passenger trains which need to limit their speeds for the safety of the passengers or simply operate on separate vactrain tube lines at slower speeds to avoid bottlenecking remotely controlled cargo vactrains.\nSmart Freeways are technologically advanced freeway systems that intelligently manage and direct traffic and may include electronic guidance and monitoring systems to advise both self-driving and manual-driving traffic and avoid traffic jams or redirect traffic to avoid buildups."

 inframunicipal_I_desc:0 "Arterial highways are high capacity high-speed inner city transport systems meant to aid long-distance travel within’ large cities and improve commuting times and commercial logistics. Arterial highways come with collector roads that feed traffic to and from the arterial highways to allow vehicles to speed up or leave an area. Additionally, arterial highways greatly benefit emergency services which can cross greater distances in short amounts of time, especially benefitting the fire department who can promptly respond to industrial fires or widespread fires that pull resources from multiple stations."
 inframunicipal_II_desc:0 "Trunk roads are roads that specialize in servicing heavy-duty industrial traffic such as trucks and feature wider lanes and are built specifically to service heavy commercial and industrial logistical traffic. Arterial trunk roads streamline city logistics and allow industries to supply each-other more promptly or transport goods from inter-city transit hubs to industries or commerce or back. Arterial trunk roads can also aid the postal system greatly as having these specialized roads lets post-sorting facilities more easily move deliveries around town at consistent schedules."
 inframunicipal_III_desc:0 "A large assortment of different public transit systems and improvements, advanced public transit systems encompass improvements to existing public transit systems or novel ones. High-speed metros, high-capacity buses, monorails, modern ferries and cable cars, and potentially even experimental public transit systems overwhelmingly cut down commute times and substantially increase commuting capacity. Additionally, advanced public transit systems can create a feedback loop in which better and cheaper access to commuting options leads to less traffic which leads to more efficient commuting and to overall savings on transportation which allows more income and thus leads to more public transit etc creating a gradual growth of public transit systems."
 inframunicipal_IV_desc:0 "Having high-throughput intersections and freeflow blocks greatly reduces travel time and reduces costs by reducing time at stops and journey time irregularities. Properly managing municipal roads and establishing them in such a way to direct traffic to avoid intersections reduces in-city traffic problems and can also reduce duel usage. It can also improve productivity and enhance the quality of life by reducing traffic buildups."
 inframunicipal_V_desc:0 "3D Municipal Infrastructure is a highly advanced system to increase the overall level of road and railspace within’ a city. It includes everything from elevated or underground cargo railways, underground trunk roads, under-over-ground abouts, multiple city layers to allow underground highways to save space above ground for long distance high-speed traffic, underground service roads for garbage or emergency services to cut across difficult to navigate above ground city traffic, amongst other things. 3D municipal infrastructure planning can greatly allow city planners to overcome terrain and space limitations and provide an easy way out to difficult infrastructure questions. It is, however, extremely expensive and can provide challenges to navigation placing an immense burden on planners."
 inframunicipal_VI_desc:0 "Smart City Infrastructure is a broad term for information age city infrastructure. It includes advanced navigation systems, intelligent designs for roads and rail, information age public transit systems that are faster, more efficient, and have larger capacities. Smart City Infrastructure can intelligently interface with guidance systems allowing drivers to avoid traffic and efficiently direct drivers in such a way to avoid overburdening immediate roads, direct emergency services far more efficiently, improve travel times, and lower overall traffic.
